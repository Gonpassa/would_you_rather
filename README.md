"Would You Rather?" is a full-stack web application that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. The app's architecture separates the application logic into three interconnected components, the model, the view, and the controller.

The model handles data storage and retrieval, the view handles the UI design and display, while the controller manages the communication between the model and the view.

Using this architecture provides a well-organized and efficient development process, enabling the development team to build an engaging and fun experience for users.

## Lessons Learned:

Working as a team on this project emphasized for us the importance of effective collaboration and communication. Regular meetings, clear task assignments, and open discussions helped us stay on the same page and avoid misunderstandings.

Implementing the MVC architecture really helped with our workflow. Separating the application logic into components resulted in better organized code, while allowing us to work on different tasks at the same time.

Overall, it was a great learning experience, teaching us the importance of teamwork and architectural patterns in group projects.
