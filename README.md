"Would You Rather?" is a full-stack web application that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. The app's architecture separates the application logic into three interconnected components, the model, the view, and the controller.

The model handles data storage and retrieval, the view handles the UI design and display, while the controller manages the communication between the model and the view.

Using this architecture provides a well-organized and efficient development process, enabling the development team to build an engaging and fun experience for users
